Project Description:

My colleagues and I compared used The Economist's Big Mac index to measure the purchasing power of a selection of countries.  McDonald's Big Mac is one of a list of items used by economists to understand currency valuations, since its recipe is the same around the world.  We explored the dataset to fulfill our task, which was to create a compelling, story-telling visualization.
